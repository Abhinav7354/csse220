The java development environment we will be using in 220 is Eclipse.
No particular version of java/eclipse is required, so if you've got
one installed it will probably work fine.  But if you don't, follow
the steps below.

# Install Java

The thing you want to install is the "Java 8 SE Development Kit"

<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Download it here</a>



Click the radio button that says "Accept License Agreement".  Then
select the "Windows x64 version".

Then run the downloaded file and install it in the default location.

# Install Eclipse

The thing you want to install is the Eclipse IDE for EE Developers.

<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Download it here</a>

There should be a "Download 64-bit" button for the latest version of
eclipse (eclipse version usually have space names like Photon etc.).

Then run the downloaded file it will ask which version you'd like to
install.  Select the Eclipse IDE for EE Developers.

After that, just install eclipse following the defaults.
